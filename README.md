## Migrations
Before starting the project, make sure your development DB is up to date. 
Run the following command in src folder:

    flask db upgrade

If you make a change that requires a DB schema update, create a migration:

    flask db migrate -m "Short description"

If you create empty revision file, create with this command:

    flask db revision -m "Short description"

If you want to downgrade to a specific revision of a migration:

    flask db downgrade <revision_id>
